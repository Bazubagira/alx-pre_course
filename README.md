## Create and setup my Git and GitHub account

This project is about how to use Git. It is my first project in  _ALX school_, It shows  how to create a md file and how to push that file into repository.

---


 -  The first thing to do is to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git),
 -   I did not have a git account so I created it from [here](https://github.com),
 
 -  I configured it with email and username,I then immediately got an email message the GitHub launch code for signing up,
 -  and after completing it got a welcome to GitHub message on my computer.

 By getting started , I complete my profile and create a repository for projects. I created a repository called **alx-pre_course** and this is where I am going to push my file .

 Bellow is how reached here step by step :

  -  open a terminal( GitBash),
 - create a directory and name it alx-pre_course,
 - navigate to that directory,
 - run git init,
 - run git add .,
 - run git status to check if the file is present,
 - run git commit -m,
 - run git branch -M main
 - run git remote add origin
 - run git push -u origin main.
